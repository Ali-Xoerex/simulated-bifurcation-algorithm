        Computes an approximated solution of the Ising problem using the
        Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. The ground state in modified in place.
        It should correspond to a local minimum for the Ising energy function.

        The Simulated Bifurcation (SB) algorithm mimics Hamiltonian dynamics to
        make spins evolve throughout time. It uses a symplectic Euler scheme
        for this purpose.

        There are different version of the SB algorithm:
        - the ballistic Simulated Bifurcation (bSB) which uses the particles'
        position for the matrix computations (usually slower but more accurate)
        - the discrete Simulated Bifurcation (dSB) which uses the particles'
        spin for the matrix computations (usually faster but less accurate)
        - the Heated ballistic Simulated Bifurcation (HbSB) which uses the bSB
        algorithm with a supplementary non-symplectic term to refine the model
        - the Heated ballistic Simulated Bifurcation (HdSB) which uses the dSB
        algorithm with a supplementary non-symplectic term to refine the model

        To stop the iterations of the Euler scheme, a number of maximum steps
        needs to be specified. However a refined way to stop is also possible
        using a window that checks that the spins have not changed among a set
        number of previous steps. In practice, a every fixed number of steps
        (called a sampling period) the current spins will be compared to the
        previous ones. If they remain constant throughout a certain number of
        consecutive samplings (called the convergence threshold), the spins are
        considered to have bifurcated and the algorithm stops.

        Finally, it is possible to make several particle vectors at the same
        time (each one being called an agent). As the vectors are randomly
        initialized, using several agents helps exploring the solution space
        and increases the probability of finding a better solution, though it
        also slightly increases the computation time. In the end, only the best
        spin vector (energy-wise) is kept and used as the new Ising model'
        ground state.
